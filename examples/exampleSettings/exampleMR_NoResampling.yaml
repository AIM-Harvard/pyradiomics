# This is an example of settings that can be used as a starting point for analyzing MR data without resampling. This may
# be especially usefull where there is a very large difference in in-plane spacing and slice thickness. This example
# uses forced 2D extraction to handle the anisotropic voxels. It assumes that the input are axial slices. If a different
# orientation is used, update the force2Ddimension parameter accordingly.

# This is only intended as a starting point and is not likely to be the optimal settings for your dataset.
# Some points in determining better values are added as comments where appropriate

# When adapting and using these settings for an analysis, be sure to add the PyRadiomics version used to allow you to
# easily recreate your extraction at a later timepoint:

setting:
  # Normalization:
  # MR signal is usually relative, with large differences between scanners and vendors. By normalizing the image before
  # feature calculation, this confounding effect may be reduced. However, if only one specific scanner is used, or the
  # images reflect some absolute world value (e.g. ADC maps, T2maps (NOT T2 weighted)), consider disabling the
  # normalization.
  normalize: true
  normalizeScale: 100  # This allows you to use more or less the same bin width.

  # Resampling:
  # Not enabled in this example. However, because texture calculation assumes isotropic spacing, a forced 2D extraction
  # is used, therefore only requiring the voxels to be isotropic in-plane. Enable pre-cropping to reduce memory
  # footprint and speed up applying the filters.
  preCrop: true

  # Forced 2D extracion:
  # This allows to calculate texture features using anisotropic voxels (although it assumes that voxels are isotropic
  # in-plane). This is an alternative to resampling the image to isotropic voxels.
  force2D: true
  force2Ddimension: 0  # axial slices, for coronal slices, use dimension 1 and for sagittal, dimension 2.

  # Mask validation:
  # correctMask and geometryTolerance are not needed, as both image and mask are resampled, if you expect very small
  # masks, consider to enable a size constraint by uncommenting settings below:
  #minimumROIDimensions: 2
  #minimumROISize: 50

  # Image discretization:
  # The ideal number of bins is somewhere in the order of 16-128 bins. A possible way to define a good binwidt is to
  # extract firstorder:Range from the dataset to analyze, and choose a binwidth so, that range/binwidth remains approximately
  # in this range of bins.
  binWidth: 5

  # first order specific settings:
  # When normalizing, gray values below the mean will be negative. Shifting by 300 (3 StdDevs * 100) ensures that the
  # majority of voxels is positive (only outliers >3 SD lower than the mean will be negative).
  voxelArrayShift: 300

  # default label value. Labels can also be defined in the call to featureextractor.execute, as a commandline argument,
