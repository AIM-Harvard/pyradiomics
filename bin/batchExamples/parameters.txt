Example of parameters file

Parameters must be specified using following convention:
- A parameter should be on a single line
- A parameter should be enclosed in brackets, start with the name and followed by the value,
  separated by spaces: (<parameter type> <parameter name> <value>). Additional spaces in <value> are ignored.
- <value> is represented in JSON format:
    - Multiple values are enclosed by square brackets and comma separated: [..., ...]
    - Dictionary values are enclosed by curly braces, where key:value pairs are comma separated and keys and values
      are separated by a semicolon: {key:value, key:value, ...}
    - String values should be enclosed by quotes: "..."
    - Numbers should not be quoted: 3.14

Parameter type refers to the type of the parameter. This can be one of the following:
- setting: Setting to use for preprocessing and class specific settings. if no <value> is specified, the value for this
  setting is set to None.
- featureClass: Feature class to enable, <value> is list of strings representing enabled features. If no <value> is
  specified or <value> is an empty list, all features for this class are enabled.
- inputImage: input image to calculate features on. <value> is custom kwarg settings (dictionary). if no <value> is
  specified or <value> is an empty dictionary, no custom settings are added for this input image.

\\ Input Images
\\ Enable filter specific settings by specifying a dictionary of "setting":<value>, e.g. {"binWidth": 10, "verbose":true}
(inputImage original)
(inputImage log)
(inputImage wavelet)

\\ Featureclasses
\\ Limit features calculated by class by specifying list of strings, e.g. ["Mean", "Skewness"] in firstorder
(featureClass shape)
(featureClass firstorder)
(featureClass glcm)
(featureClass glrlm)
(featureClass glszm)

\\ Settings
(setting binWidth 25)
(setting interpolator 3) \\ sitk.sitkBSpline
(setting resampledPixelSpacing null) \\ No resampling, set to [3, 3, 3] to enable resampling to 3 x 3 x 3 mm voxels
(setting verbose false)
