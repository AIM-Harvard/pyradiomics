setting:
  # Normalization:
  # most likely not needed, CT gray values reflect absolute world values (HU) and should be comparable between scanners.
  # If analyzing using different scanners / vendors, check if the extracted features are correlated to the scanner used.
  # If so, consider enabling normalization by uncommenting settings below:
  #normalize: true
  #normalizeScale: 500  # This allows you to use more or less the same bin width.

  # Resampling:
  # Usual spacing for CT is often close to 1 or 2 mm, if very large slice thickness is used,
  # increase the resampled spacing.
  # On a side note: increasing the resampled spacing forces PyRadiomics to look at more coarse textures, which may or
  # may not increase accuracy and stability of your extracted features.
  interpolator: 'sitkBSpline'
  resampledPixelSpacing: [1, 1, 1]
  padDistance: 10  # Extra padding for large sigma valued LoG filtered images

  # Mask validation:
  # correctMask and geometryTolerance are not needed, as both image and mask are resampled, if you expect very small
  # masks, consider to enable a size constraint by uncommenting settings below:
  #minimumROIDimensions: 2
  #minimumROISize: 50

  # Image discretization:
  # The ideal number of bins is somewhere in the order of 16-128 bins. A possible way to define a good binwidt is to
  # extract firstorder:Range from the dataset to analyze, and choose a binwidth so, that range/binwidth remains approximately
  # in this range of bins.
  binWidth: 25

  # first order specific settings:
  voxelArrayShift: 1000  # Minimum value in HU is -1000, shift +1000 to prevent negative values from being squared.

  # Misc:
  # default label value. Labels can also be defined in the call to featureextractor.execute, as a commandline argument,
  # or in a column "Label" in the input csv (batchprocessing)
