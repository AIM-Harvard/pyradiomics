    r"""
    In this group of features we included descriptors of the three-dimensional size and shape of the ROI. These features
    are independent from the gray level intensity distribution in the ROI and are therefore only calculated on the
    non-derived image and mask.

    Unless otherwise specified, features are derived from the approximated shape defined by the triangle mesh. To build
    this mesh, vertices (points) are first defined as points halfway on an edge between a voxel included in the ROI and
    one outside the ROI. By connecting these vertices a mesh of connected triangles is obtained, with each triangle
    defined by 3 adjacent vertices, which shares each side with exactly one other triangle.

    This mesh is generated using a marching cubes algorithm. In this algorithm, a 2x2 cube is moved through the mask
    space. For each position, the corners of the cube are then marked 'segmented' (1) or 'not segmented' (0). Treating the
    corners as specific bits in a binary number, a unique cube-index is obtained (0-255). This index is then used to
    determine which triangles are present in the cube, which are defined in a lookup table.

    These triangles are defined in such a way, that the normal (obtained from the cross product of vectors describing 2
    out of 3 edges) are always oriented in the same direction. For PyRadiomics, the calculated normals are always pointing
    outward. This is necessary to obtain the correct signed volume used in calculation of ``MeshVolume``.

    Let:

    - :math:`N_v` represent the number of voxels included in the ROI
    - :math:`N_f` represent the number of faces (triangles) defining the Mesh.
    - :math:`V` the volume of the mesh in mm\ :sup:`3`, calculated by :py:func:`getMeshVolumeFeatureValue`
    - :math:`A` the surface area of the mesh in mm\ :sup:`2`, calculated by :py:func:`getMeshSurfaceAreaFeatureValue`
