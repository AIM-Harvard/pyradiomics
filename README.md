# pyradiomics v1.0

## Radiomics feature extraction in Python

This is an open-source python package for the extraction of Radiomics features from 2D and 3D images and 
binary masks.

Image loading and preprocessing (e.g. resampling and cropping) are first done using `SimpleITK`. 
Then, loaded data are converted into numpy arrays for further calculation using feature classes
outlined below.

### Feature Classes
Currently supports the following feature classes:

 - First Order Statistics
 - Shape-based
 - [Gray Level Cooccurence Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-occurrence_matrix) (GLCM)
 - [Gray Level Run Length Matrix](http://www.insight-journal.org/browse/publication/231) (GLRLM)
 - [Gray Level Size Zone Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_level_size_zone_matrix) (GLSZM)

### Filter Classes
Aside from the feature classes, there are also some built-in optional filters:

- Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG, based on SimpleITK functionality)
- Wavelet (using the PyWavelets package)
- Square
- Square Root
- Logarithm
- Exponential

Most of the provided features and filters are based on methods described in the following publications:

HJWL Aerts, ER Velazquez, RTH Leijenaar, et al., "Decoding tumour phenotype by noninvasive imaging using a quantitative radiomics approach", vol. 5, Nat Communication, 2014. Available [here](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140603/ncomms5006/full/ncomms5006.html).

Specifically, the formulation of the individual feature calculation is covered in this [supplement](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140603/ncomms5006/extref/ncomms5006-s1.pdf)

### Supporting reproducible extraction
Aside from calculating features, the pyradiomics package includes provenance information in the
output. This information contains information on used image and mask, as well as applied settings
and filters, thereby enabling fully reproducible feature extraction.

### Documentation

For more information, see the sphinx generated documentation.
This can be generated by checking out the master branch and running from the root directory:

    python setup.py build_sphinx

The documentation can then be viewed in a browser by opening `PACKAGE_ROOT\build\sphinx\html\index.html`. 

### Installation

To install this package run the following commands from the root directory:

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py install

### Citation 
If you publish any work which uses this package, please cite the following publication:

Joost J.M. van Griethuysen et al, “Computational Radiomics System to Decode the Radiographic Phenotype”; Submitted

### 3rd-party packages used in pyradiomics:
