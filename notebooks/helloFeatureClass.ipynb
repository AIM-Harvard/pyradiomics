    "Calculating features on filtered images is very similar to calculating features on the original image. All filters in PyRadiomics have the same input and output signature, and there is even one for applying no filter. This enables to loop over a list of requested filters and apply them in the same piece of code. It is applied like this in the execute function in feature extractor. The input for the filters is the image, with additional keywords. If no additional keywords are supplied, the filter uses default values where applicable. It returns a [generator object](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html?#yield), allowing to define the generators to be applied before the filters functions are actually called."
