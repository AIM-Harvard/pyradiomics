def setVerbosity(level):
  """
  Change the amount of information PyRadiomics should print out during extraction. The lower the level, the more
  information is printed to the output (stderr).

  Using the ``level`` (Python defined logging levels) argument, the following levels are possible:

  - 60: Quiet mode, no messages are printed to the stderr
  - 50: Only log messages of level "CRITICAL" are printed
  - 40: Log messages of level "ERROR" and up are printed
  - 30: Log messages of level "WARNING" and up are printed
  - 20: Log messages of level "INFO" and up are printed
  - 10: Log messages of level "DEBUG" and up are printed (i.e. all log messages)

  By default, the radiomics logger is set to level "INFO" and the stderr handler to level "WARNING". Therefore a log
  storing the extraction log messages from level "INFO" and up can be easily set up by adding an appropriate handler to
  the radiomics logger, while the output to stderr will still only contain warnings and errors.

  .. note::

    This function assumes the handler added to the radiomics logger at initialization of the toolbox is not removed from
    the logger handlers and therefore remains the first handler.

  .. note::

    This does not affect the level of the logger itself (e.g. if verbosity level = 3, log messages with DEBUG level can
    still be stored in a log file if an appropriate handler is added to the logger and the logging level of the logger
    has been set to the correct level. *Exception: In case the verbosity is set to DEBUG, the level of the logger is
    also lowered to DEBUG. If the verbosity level is then raised again, the logger level will remain DEBUG.*

  3. Is iterable (i.e. at least specifies an __iter__ function, which iterates over the iterable passed at

  It is also possible to create your own progress reporter. To achieve this, additionally specify a function `__next__`,
  and have the `__iter__` function return `self`. The `__next__` function takes no arguments and returns a call to the
  `__next__` function of the iterable (i.e. `return self.iterable.__next__()`). Any prints/progress reporting calls can
  then be inserted in this function prior to the return statement.
