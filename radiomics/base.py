class RadiomicsFeaturesBase(object):
  """
  This is the abstract class, which defines the common interface for the feature classes. All feature classes inherit
  (directly of indirectly) from this class.

  At initialization, image and labelmap are passed as SimpleITK image objects (``inputImage`` and ``inputMask``,
  respectively.) The motivation for using SimpleITK images as input is to keep the possibility of reusing the
  optimized feature calculators implemented in SimpleITK in the future. If either the image or the mask is None,
  initialization fails and a warning is logged (does not raise an error).

  Logging is set up using a child logger from the parent 'radiomics' logger. This retains the toolbox structure in
  the generated log.

  The following variables are instantiated at initialization:

  - binWidth: bin width, as specified in ``**kwargs``. If key is not present, a default value of 25 is used.
  - label: label value of Region of Interest (ROI) in labelmap. If key is not present, a default value of 1 is used.
  - verbose: boolean indication whether or not to provide progress reporting to the output.
  - featureNames: list containing the names of features defined in the feature class. See :py:func:`getFeatureNames`
  - inputImage: Simple ITK image object of the input image
  - inputMask: Simple ITK image object of the input labelmap
  - imageArray: numpy array of the gray values in the input image
  - maskArray: numpy array with elements set to 1 where labelmap = label, 0 otherwise
  - matrix: numpy array of the gray values in the input image (with gray values inside ROI discretized when necessary in
    the texture feature classes).
  - matrixCoordinates: tuple of 3 numpy arrays containing the z, x and y coordinates of the voxels included in the ROI,
    respectively. Length of each array is equal to total number of voxels inside ROI.
  - targetVoxelArray: flattened numpy array of gray values inside ROI.
