# This is an example of how a PyRadiomics Model looks like.
# It consists of 2 main parts: "extraction" and "model"
#
# "extraction": this part defines the settings PyRadiomics needs to extract the required features for the input.
# A model can incorporate features extracted from different images (e.g. multiple time points, or different MR
# sequences). For each image, a customized extraction may be defined by providing the image name as a key, and the
# customization as a value. This customization value must adhere to the same rules as a parameter file.
# In addition, extraction parameters that are common to all input images can be defined under "general". Be aware,
# "general" is therefore not allowed as an image name.
# If an image name is provided in the model, but not included in the extraction settings, no additional customization
# is applied for that image (just the general settings, if present)
#
# "model": this part provides all needed information to build the model. In this case, a simple linear regression model
# is shown. Both the "name" key (identifying the model type) and "parameters" key (providing model specific parameters)
# are required. What kind of parameters are possible/required depends on the model. In this case, only the intercept of
# the model and the betas (slopes) of the included features are required.
