class RadiomicsFeaturesBase(object):
  """
  This is the abstract class, which defines the common interface for the feature classes. All feature classes inherit
  (directly of indirectly) from this class.

  At initialization, image and labelmap are passed as SimpleITK image objects (``inputImage`` and ``inputMask``,
  respectively.) The motivation for using SimpleITK images as input is to keep the possibility of reusing the
  optimized feature calculators implemented in SimpleITK in the future. If either the image or the mask is None,
  initialization fails and a warning is logged (does not raise an error).

  Logging is set up using a child logger from the parent 'radiomics' logger. This retains the toolbox structure in
  the generated log. The child logger is named after the module containing the feature class (e.g. 'radiomics.glcm').

  Any pre calculations needed before the feature functions are called can be added by overriding the
  ``_initSegmentBasedCalculation`` function, which prepares the input for feature extraction. If image discretization is
  needed, this can be implemented by adding a call to ``_applyBinning`` to this initialization function, which also
  instantiates coefficients holding the maximum ('Ng') and unique ('GrayLevels') that can be found inside the ROI after
  binning. This function also instantiates the `matrix` variable, which holds the discretized image (the `imageArray`
  variable will hold only original gray levels).

  The following variables are instantiated at initialization:

  - kwargs: dictionary holding all customized settings passed to this feature class.
  - label: label value of Region of Interest (ROI) in labelmap. If key is not present, a default value of 1 is used.
  - featureNames: list containing the names of features defined in the feature class. See :py:func:`getFeatureNames`
  - inputImage: SimpleITK image object of the input image (dimensions x, y, z)

  The following variables are instantiated by the ``_initSegmentBasedCalculation`` function:

  - inputMask: SimpleITK image object of the input labelmap (dimensions x, y, z)
  - imageArray: numpy array of the gray values in the input image (dimensions z, y, x)
  - maskArray: numpy boolean array with elements set to ``True`` where labelmap = label, ``False`` otherwise,
    (dimensions z, y, x).
  - labelledVoxelCoordinates: tuple of 3 numpy arrays containing the z, x and y coordinates of the voxels included in
    the ROI, respectively. Length of each array is equal to total number of voxels inside ROI.
  - matrix: copy of the imageArray variable, with gray values inside ROI discretized using the specified binWidth.
    This variable is only instantiated if a call to ``_applyBinning`` is added to an override of
    ``_initSegmentBasedCalculation`` in the feature class.

  .. note::
    Although some variables listed here have similar names to customization settings, they do *not* represent all the
    possible settings on the feature class level. These variables are listed here to help developers develop new feature
    classes, which make use of these variables. For more information on customization, see
    :ref:`radiomics-customization-label`, which includes a comprehensive list of all possible settings, including
    default values and explanation of usage.
