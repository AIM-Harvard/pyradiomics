pyradiomics labs is a collection of exploratory/experimental features that are part of the repository, but are not part of the core functionality. We welcome user feedback about those features. Those scripts and features may change in the future.

About
#####

This is an experimental script to support the use of pyradiomics with DICOM data.

The script will accept as input a directory with a single DICOM image study for the input image,
and the file name pointing to a DICOM Segmentation Image (DICOM SEG) object.

The script will transparently convert the DICOM image into a representation suitable by pyradiomics
using either plastimatch or dcm2niix.

Why?
####

* medical image data usually comes in DICOM, and pyradiomics users often ask for help working with DICOM data
* there are public collections of data on TCIA where segmentations are stored as DICOM SEG
* the use of DICOM representation for radiomics features

  * introduces standardized formalism for the attributes that should be stored to accompany the features
  * allows to link results of calculations with the various ontologies describing the anatomy of the regions
    analyzed, and the features itself (e.g., the SR document produced by the script will utilize IBSI nomenclature
    to describe those features implemented in pyradiomics that have correspondence in IBSI)
  * allows to reference (by unique identifiers) the DICOM image series and DICOM segmentation used for feature
    calculation
  * enables harmonized representation of data for images, segmentations and features (i.e., same data management
    system can be used for all data types)
  * does not prevent the use of the results in software tools that are not DICOM-aware - dcmqi can be used to
    convert DICOM segmentations and DICOM SR with the measurements into non-DICOM representation (ITK-readable
    image formats for segmentations, and JSON for measurements); a separate tool is available to generate
    tab-delimited representation for DICOM attributes and measurements stored in those SRs:
    https://github.com/QIICR/dcm2tables

Prerequisites
#############

* `plastimatch <http://plastimatch.org/plastimatch.html>`_ or `dcm2niix <https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix>`_ for
  image volume reconstruction
* dcmqi [1]_ [2]_ (build from `fedb41 <https://github.com/QIICR/dcmqi/commit/3638930723bf1a239515409c1f9ec886a9fedb41>`_
  or later) for reading DICOM SEG and converting to a representation suitable by pyradiomics, and for storing the
  resulting features as a DICOM Structured Report, instantiating SR TID 1500
* prior to using this script, you might want to sort your DICOM data such that individual series
  are stored in separate directories. You might find this tool useful for this purpose: https://github.com/pieper/dicomsort
* if you segmentations are not stored as DICOM SEG, you can use dcmqi for generating standard representation
  of those segmentations: https://github.com/QIICR/dcmqi

Usage
#####

Example usage from command line::

    $ python pyradiomics-dcm.py -h
    usage: pyradiomics-dcm.py --input-image <dir> --input-seg <name> --output-sr <name>

    Warning: This is a "pyradiomics labs" script, which means it is an experimental feature in development!
    The intent of this helper script is to enable pyradiomics feature extraction directly from/to DICOM data.
    The segmentation defining the region of interest must be defined as a DICOM Segmentation image.
    Support for DICOM Radiotherapy Structure Sets for defining region of interest may be added in the future.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --input-image-dir Input DICOM image directory
                        Directory with the input DICOM series. It is expected
                        that a single series is corresponding to a single
                        scalar volume.
      --input-seg-file Input DICOM SEG file
                        Input segmentation defined as aDICOM Segmentation
                        object.
      --output-dir Directory to store the output file
                        Directory for saving the resulting DICOM file.
      --parameters pyradiomics extraction parameters
      --temp-dir Temporary directory
      --features-dict Dictionary mapping pyradiomics feature names to the IBSI defined features.
      --volume-reconstructor Choose the tool to be used for reconstructing image volume from the DICOM image series. Allowed options are plastimatch or dcm2niix (should be installed on the system). plastimatch will be used by default.
