-------
Example
-------

* PyRadiomics example code and data is available in the `Github repository <https://github.com/Radiomics/pyradiomics>`_

* The sample data is provided in ``pyradiomics/data``

* Use `jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>`_ to run the helloRadiomics example, located in ``pyradiomics/notebooks``

* Jupyter can also be used to run the example notebook as shown in the instruction video

  * The example notebook can be found in ``pyradiomics/notebooks``

  * The parameter file used in the instruction video is available in ``pyradiomics/examples/exampleSettings``

* If jupyter is not installed, run the python script alternatives contained in the folder (``pyradiomics/examples``):

  * ``python helloRadiomics.py`` (segment-based extraction)
  * ``python helloVoxel.py`` (voxel-based extraction)

----------------------
Voxel-based extraction
----------------------

As of version 2.0, pyradiomics also implements a voxel-based extraction. It is both available from the command line and
in the interactive use. See below for details.

Important to know here is that this extraction takes longer (features have to be calculated for each voxel), and that
the output is a SimpleITK image of the parameter map instead of a float value *for each feature*.

----------------
Command Line Use
----------------

PyRadiomics can be used directly from the commandline via the entry point ``pyradiomics``. Depending on the input
provided, PyRadiomics is run in either single-extraction or batch-extraction mode. All options available on the
commandline can be listed by running::

    pyradiomics -h

Single image/mask
#################
To extract features from a single image and segmentation run::

    pyradiomics <path/to/image> <path/to/segmentation>

Batch Mode
##########
To extract features from a batch run::

    pyradiomics <path/to/input>

The input file for batch processing is a CSV file where the first row is contains headers and each subsequent row
represents one combination of an image and a segmentation and contains at least 2 elements: 1) path/to/image,
2) path/to/mask. The headers specify the column names and **must** be "Image" and "Mask" for image and mask location,
respectively (capital sensitive). Additional columns may also be specified, all columns are copied to the output in
the same order (with calculated features appended after last column). To specify custom values for ``label`` in each
combination, a column "Label" can optionally be added, which specifies the desired extraction label for each
combination. Values specified in this column take precedence over label values specified in the parameter file or on
the commandline. If a row contains no value, the default (or globally customized) value is used instead. Similarly,
an optional value for the ``label_channel`` setting can be provided in a column "Label_channel".

.. note::

  All headers should be unique and different from headers provided by PyRadiomics (``<filter>_<class>_<feature>``).
  In case of conflict, values are overwritten by the PyRadiomics values.

.. note::

  In batch processing, it is possible to speed up the process by applying multiprocessing. This is done on the
  case-level (i.e. each thread processes a single case). You can enable this by adding the ``--jobs`` parameter,
  specifying how many parallel threads you want to use.

Customization
#############
Extraction can be customized by specifying a :ref:`parameter file <radiomics-parameter-file-label>` in the ``--param``
argument and/or by specifying override settings (only :ref:`type 3 customization <radiomics-settings-label>`) in the
``--setting`` argument. Multiple overrides can be used by specifying ``--setting`` multiple times.

Output
######
By default, results are printed out to the console window. To store the results in a CSV-structured text file, add the
``-o <PATH>`` and ``-f csv`` arguments, where ``<PATH>`` specifies the filepath where the results should be stored.
e.g.::

    pyradiomics <path/to/image> <path/to/segmentation> -o results.csv -f csv
    pyradiomics <path/to/input> -o results.csv -f csv

Voxel-based Radiomics
#####################
To extract feature maps ("voxel-based" extraction), simply add the argument ``--mode voxel``. The calculated feature
maps are then stored as images (NRRD format) in the current working directory. The name convention used is
"Case-<idx>_<FeatureName>.nrrd". An alternative output directory can be provided in the ``--out-dir`` command line
switch. The results that are printed to the console window or the out file will still contain the diagnostic
information, and the value of the extracted features is set to the location where the feature maps are stored.

---------------
Interactive Use
---------------

* (LINUX) To run from source code, add pyradiomics to the environment variable PYTHONPATH (Not necessary when
  PyRadiomics is installed):

  *  ``setenv PYTHONPATH /path/to/pyradiomics/radiomics``

* Start the python interactive session:

  * ``python``

* Import the necessary classes::

     import os

     import SimpleITK as sitk

     from radiomics import featureextractor, getTestCase

* Set up a pyradiomics directory variable::

    dataDir = '/path/to/pyradiomics'

* You will find sample data files brain1_image.nrrd and brain1_label.nrrd in that directory. Note that NRRD format used here does not mean that your image and label must always be in this format. Any format readable by ITK is suitable (e.g., NIfTI, MHA, MHD, HDR, etc). See more details in this section of FAQ :ref:`radiomics_input_formats`.

* Store the path of your image and mask in two variables::

    imageName, maskName = getTestCase('brain1', dataDir)

* Also store the path to the file containing the extraction settings::

    params = os.path.join(dataDir, "examples", "exampleSettings", "Params.yaml")

* Instantiate the feature extractor class with the parameter file::

    extractor = featureextractor.RadiomicsFeatureExtractor(params)

* Calculate the features (segment-based)::

    result = extractor.execute(imageName, maskName)
    for key, val in result.items():
      print("\t%s: %s" %(key, val))

* Calculate the features (voxel-based)::

    result = extractor.execute(imageName, maskName, voxelBased=True)
    for key, val in result.items():
      if isinstance(val, sitk.Image):  # Feature map
        sitk.WriteImage(val, key + '.nrrd', True)
        print("Stored feature %s in %s" % (key, key + ".nrrd"))
      else:  # Diagnostic information
        print("\t%s: %s" %(key, val))

* See the :ref:`feature extractor class<radiomics-featureextractor-label>` for more information on using this core class.

PyRadiomics in 3D Slicer
------------------------

A convenient front-end interface is provided as the 'Radiomics' extension for 3D Slicer. It is available
`here <https://github.com/Radiomics/SlicerRadiomics>`_.

.. _radiomics-logging-label:

------------------
Setting Up Logging
------------------

PyRadiomics features extensive logging to help track down any issues with the extraction of features.
By default PyRadiomics logging reports messages of level WARNING and up (reporting any warnings or errors that occur),
and prints this to the output (stderr). By default, PyRadiomics does not create a log file.

To change the amount of information that is printed to the output, use :py:func:`~radiomics.setVerbosity` in interactive
use and the optional ``--verbosity`` argument in commandline use.

When using PyRadiomics in interactive mode, enable storing the PyRadiomics logging in a file by adding an appropriate
handler to the pyradiomics logger::

    import radiomics

    log_file = 'path/to/log_file.txt'
    handler = logging.FileHandler(filename=log_file, mode='w')  # overwrites log_files from previous runs. Change mode to 'a' to append.
    formatter = logging.Formatter("%(levelname)s:%(name)s: %(message)s")  # format string for log messages
    handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    radiomics.logger.addHandler(handler)

    # Control the amount of logging stored by setting the level of the logger. N.B. if the level is higher than the
    # Verbositiy level, the logger level will also determine the amount of information printed to the output
    radiomics.logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

To store a log file when running pyradiomics from the commandline, specify a file location in the optional
``--log-file`` argument. The amount of logging that is stored is controlled by the ``--logging-level`` argument
(default level WARNING and up).
