class RadiomicsShape2D(base.RadiomicsFeaturesBase):
    r"""
    In this group of features we included descriptors of the two-dimensional size and shape of the ROI. These features
    are independent from the gray level intensity distribution in the ROI and are therefore only calculated on the
    non-derived image and mask.

    Unless otherwise specified, features are derived from the approximated shape defined by the circumference mesh. To
    build this mesh, vertices (points) are first defined as points halfway on an edge between a pixel included in the ROI
    and one outside the ROI. By connecting these vertices a mesh of connected lines is obtained, with each line
    defined by 2 adjacent vertices, which shares each a point with exactly one other line.

    This mesh is generated using an adapted version marching cubes algorithm. In this algorithm, a 2x2 square is moved
    through the mask space (2d). For each position, the corners of the square are then marked 'segmented' (1) or
    'not segmented' (0). Treating the corners as specific bits in a binary number, a unique square-index is obtained
    (0-15). This index is then used to determine which lines are present in the square, which are defined in a lookup
    table.

    These lines are defined in such a way, that the normal of the triangle defined by these points and the origin
    is always oriented in the a consistent direction. This results in signed values for the surface area of each triangle,
    so that when summed, the superfluous (postive) area included by triangles partly inside and outside the ROI is
    perfectly cancelled out by the (negative) area of triangles entirely outside the ROI.

    Let:

    - :math:`N_p` represent the number of pixels included in the ROI
    - :math:`N_f` represent the number of lines defining the circumference (perimeter) Mesh.
    - :math:`A` the surface area of the mesh in mm\ :sup:`2`, calculated by :py:func:`getMeshSurfaceFeatureValue`
    - :math:`P` the perimeter of the mesh in mm, calculated by :py:func:`getPerimeterFeatureValue`

    .. note::
      This class can **only** be calculated for truly 2D masks. To ensure correct processing, it is required that
      ``force2D`` is set to ``True`` and ``force2Ddimension`` to the dimension that is out-of plane (e.g. 0 (z-axis) for
      an axial slice). Furthermore, this dimension is required to have size 1. If not set correctly, a ValueError is
      raised.
